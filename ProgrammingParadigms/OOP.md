# Object Oriented Programming

## Ways of Implementing

1. Classes
2. Prototypes
3. Multimethods

##### Multimethods:

Another name for multiple dispatch.  A generalization of single-dispatch polymorphism.  Instead of finding method definition from derived type of
the object the method was called on, uses combined characteristics of the
arguments.
